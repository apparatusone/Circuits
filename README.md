# WIP Digital Circuit Simulator

Circuits is a tool for experimenting with logic gates and circuits. Built with JavaScript and featuring a user-friendly GUI, Circuits allows you to create and test basic logical circuits and systems, including integrated circuits.

Please note that some features of Circuits may be broken or incomplete at this time, as the program is still under development.

With Circuits, you can currently build and test your circuits using a few basic logic gates, including AND, OR, NOT, and XOR. You can also see the output of your circuit in real time, and easily modify and adjust your design to try out different combinations of gates and inputs.

Circuits is not a professional tool for designing and simulating complex logical circuits, but it can be a great way to learn the basics of logic gates and how they work, and even create your own simple integrated circuits.
